This is a repository for the lecture notes for the MIT course 10.34: Numerical Methods in Chemical Engineering. The notes are written in LaTeX and compiled using `pdflatex`. To compile the document and then clean up the directory run

```bash
make build
```

I'll release the notes here as I clean them up a few weeks ahead of each corresponding lecture. Please feel free to submit an issue or pull request if you see any errors or have any suggestions.
