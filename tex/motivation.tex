\chapter*{Preface}
This course reader was originally developed based on the Fall 2024 offering of 10.34 (Numerical Methods Applied to Chemical Engineering) at MIT taught by Profs.\ Sungho Shin and Connor Coley; it was designed as a transcription of the course slides/lectures into document form. In fact, this document began as Matthew Cox's personal notes for the course. 

This book is meant to be self-contained, but at times it may be helpful to refer to external resources for more in-depth explanations.

\begin{warningBox}
    \textbf{Warning}: This document is still a work in progress, and is not yet completely polished. It is recommended to always refer to the course slides/lectures for the most up-to-date information. If you spot any errors, feel free to email Matthew at \href{mailto:mcox340@mit.edu}{mcox340@mit.edu} (or directly submit an issue/PR on the corresponding GitHub repository if you know how to use GitHub).

% regarding the last sentence, I originally intended on linking many external resources, but that hasn't really end up happening yet...

% could be helpful to have a brief overview of the course or some motivation for the course topics here
